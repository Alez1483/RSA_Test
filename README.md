# RSA Cryption
My first try at encryption/decryption. **Don't use for any critical use cases, may contain mistakes and vulnerabilities.** Implements Java code to generate RSA keys and the required parts of ASN.1 to encode the key into text format (no decoding as of now). Also implements simple encryption and decryption of text using the generated keys.
